**Problem Statement**:
In the digital age, usernames are crucial for identity on various platforms. 
Your task is to write a program that checks if a username is neither too short nor too long, 
adhering to specific length criteria.

**Instructions**:

1. Prompt the user to enter a username.
2. Check if the username is between 5 and 15 characters long.
3. If the username meets the criteria, print a confirmation message.
4. If it does not meet the criteria, print a message indicating the username length requirements.
5. Provide the user with the option to try a different username or exit the program.

**Hints**:

- Use the `len()` function to determine the length of the username.
- Use an `if-else` statement to check if the username's length falls within the specified range.
- You'll need a while loop to drive the options.

**Problem Statement**:
You are developing a feature for a music app that allows users to create a custom playlist and play the songs in sequence.

**Instructions**:

1. Define a function called `play_songs()` that takes one parameter `song_list`.
2. Inside the function, use a loop to iterate over `song_list`.
3. For each song in the list, print a message indicating that the song is now playing.
4. Before calling the function, prompt the user to enter the number of songs they want to add to the playlist.
5. Use a loop and `input()` to accept song names from the user, based on the number they provided, and store them in a list.
6. Call the `play_songs()` function with the user-created list of songs as an argument.
